    <p>Once you have approved the purchase, you can request for your labels by email at shipping@hypeindustry.com

    <ul>
        <li>Buyerâ€™s details in full, name , full address and invoice number.</li>

        <h4>How do I pack the items I have SOLD?</h4>
        <p>
        This process is very easy! We suggest using standard Nike or Adidas boxes (29x19x16 or 30x20x15 inches), and pack 12 or 13 prs per box. If you unfold boxes properly you may be able to fit an extra pair or two! Check out this video we found (we are not in that video or know anyone in this video) it is a tutorial for sellers who do not know how to flatten shoe boxes.
         With this method you can pack 14 to 15 pairs versus 12 pairs per box:
